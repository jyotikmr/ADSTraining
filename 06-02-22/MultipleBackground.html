  <h1>SUN FLOWER</h1>
  <p>Their scientific name
    is Helianthus (which comes from the Greek words for "sun" and "flower"). Sunflowers can
    be different shapes, and some can be tall while others are short. The shortest sunflowers
    are called dwarfs and usually grow in clusters. Sunflowers can even be different colors.
    Yellow is the most common but there are also red, orange and purple sunflowers. </p>

    <h1>One is Tree and Another is a flower.</h1>
    <p>A tree and a flower are  different. The word tree refers to the complete plant whereas a flower is only an organ of a plant. Some trees produce flowers (angiosperms, i.e., maple) and some do not (gymnosperms, i.e., pine). Flowers are usually grouped together on a stem and are adapted for sexual reproduction. The flower is not an entire  plant but an organ formed by some plants for reproductive purposes.</p>
