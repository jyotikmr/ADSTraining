    Jaipur/Barmer : In November 2020, Gemara Ram Meghwal was 17 and in love. The girl was a classmate from his village, the small Kumaharo Ka Teeba in Rajasthan’s Barmer, two-and-a-half kilometres away from the international border with Pakistan. He had been warned off the relationship, by the girl’s parents, and even his own. But he was young and obstinate, and one winter night, decided it was time for drastic measures.

    But life had other plans in store for him.
    
    Circa June 2022 and Gemara Ram has spent close to a year and a half in a Pakistani jail, without the information that his father has died, or that his mother has lost her mind. On May 27, he wrote a letter to his family from a Karachi prison, begging for their forgiveness, and asking to be brought home.
    
    At Kumaharo Ka Teeba, a desert village where the homes are mud and thatch, Satram Meghwal(26), Gemaram’s elder brother talks exasperatedly of his difficult younger sibling. The family is poor, all eight brothers daily wage labourers, with three sisters. “The girl is also from our village and he fell in love with her in school. This was when both of them started going to the secondary level school two kilometres away. They would walk together and that brought them closer together,” Satram said.
